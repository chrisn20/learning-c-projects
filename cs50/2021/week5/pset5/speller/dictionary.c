// CS50 Academic Honesty - when going through the CS50x 2020 version of this problem, I received some help for the solution from Youtube.
// I therefore did not submit my solution to the pset at the time as I felt it might stray on the boundary of reasonableness
// For this implementation, I have redone the full pset (including doing the new lab) without any outside help
// I am therefore comfortable that it is reasonable for me to submit this version of the pset
// In addition, I have practiced the concepts of linked lists in other problems, including some of the first few days of AoC 2020
// which can be found on my github repository: https://github.com/chrisn20/learning-c-projects/tree/main/aoc2020
// to demonstrate to myself that I fully understood these concepts and could use them for other problems.
